    </li>
    <li><h3>Multi-variable Regression Model</h3>
      <p>This project implements a [type of regression model, e.g., Multiple Linear Regression] model using the [dataset name] dataset. 
      [ Briefly describe the model, its purpose, and key findings.]</p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification</h3>
      <p>This project implements the SVM algorithm to solve a [classification problem, e.g., binary classification] problem. 
      [ Briefly describe the dataset and the implementation.]</p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Boosting and Bagging</h3>
      <p>This project implements Boosting and Bagging methods, such as [specific algorithms, e.g., AdaBoost, Random Forest], 
      and analyzes their performance on the [dataset name] dataset.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>K-means Clustering</h3>
      <p>This project implements the K-means clustering algorithm to [describe the clustering task, e.g., group customers based on their purchasing behavior]. 
      [ Briefly describe the dataset and the clustering results.]</p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Backpropagation Algorithm</h3>
      <p>This project implements the backpropagation algorithm for training a [type of neural network, e.g., feedforward neural network]. 
      [ Briefly describe the network architecture and the training process.]</p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</h3>
      <p>This project implements a CNN using the [image dataset name] dataset for [image classification task, e.g., image recognition, object detection]. 
      [ Briefly describe the CNN architecture and its performance.]</p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Transfer Learning</h3>
      <p>This project implements transfer learning using a pre-trained model on the [dataset name] dataset. 
      [ Briefly describe the pre-trained model, the transfer learning approach, and the analysis of results.]</p>
    </li>
